## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Management identity is allocated and realized Pod-locally

The direct runtime SHALL realize containerlab's always-addressed management model with
controller-allocated identities: every logical Node's management address comes from the topology's
management policy, or, when no policy is declared, from containerlab's default management subnet
and gateway convention. The runtime MUST NOT use the Pod address as a management identity. The
Pod's connectivity sidecar SHALL interpose a synthetic management interface carrying the allocated
address before any device container starts, and management configuration SHALL render at plan time
through each kind's own imported templates using the allocated address, prefix, and sidecar
gateway. The interposed management interface SHALL be a member of its namespace's management
mesh, so the allocated identity is reachable from every peer device in the namespace by
address. The sidecar SHALL realize the mesh as a routed overlay: the synthetic interface is one
pair whose far end is the sidecar's router leg, the router leg answers peer ARP with the gateway
identity, and peer-bound traffic is forwarded to the peer's tunnel endpoint through per-peer
static state derived from the mounted peer directory. The sidecar SHALL converge that peer state
when the directory changes and on a periodic resync, and SHALL re-assert the rest of its owned
mesh state on the same reconciliation tick that re-asserts its other owned state. Management
traffic crossing the mesh SHALL be subject to the path's size: a TCP handshake advertising a
segment larger than the mesh carries is clamped on the routed forward path, and an oversized
packet with fragmentation forbidden receives a fragmentation-needed response from the local
gateway. The interposed interface SHALL carry a default route via the sidecar gateway, as a
container runtime installs one, so a device that derives its management routing from the
kernel's, or that forwards a nested guest's traffic through the interface, reaches
destinations beyond the management subnet through the Pod's own network identity.

#### Scenario: Imported hook dials the management address

- **WHEN** an imported package hook running inside an application container dials the logical
  Node's management address after the device adopted the interface presented to it
- **THEN** the dial reaches the device's management plane pod-locally without any kind- or
  vendor-specific handling

#### Scenario: Operator declares a management policy

- **WHEN** the operator allocates explicit management addresses through a management policy
- **THEN** the controller-allocated addresses are used unchanged

#### Scenario: Topology declares no management policy

- **WHEN** a topology is deployed without a management policy
- **THEN** the controller allocates each node's management identity from containerlab's default
  management subnet with containerlab's gateway convention, and devices observe those addresses
  exactly as they would under containerlab

#### Scenario: Package templates render the management identity

- **WHEN** an imported kind generates configuration from its own management-parameterized templates
- **THEN** the render uses the allocated management address, prefix, and sidecar gateway at plan
  time, so a topology with no startup-config reaches full management without kind-specific handling

#### Scenario: Peer device dials the allocated identity

- **WHEN** a peer device in the same namespace dials the allocated management address from its own
  Pod
- **THEN** the dial reaches this device over the management mesh without translation, and the
  reply returns the same way

#### Scenario: Device stack reaches beyond the management subnet

- **WHEN** a device that derives its management routing from the kernel's (SR-SIM, SR Linux)
  boots, or a device forwards a nested guest's management traffic through the interposed
  interface (vrnetlab)
- **THEN** the interposed interface's default route names the sidecar gateway, the device's
  management stack installs or uses that gateway, and traffic to a cluster address leaves
  through the Pod's own network identity and its reply reaches the device

#### Scenario: Device sends an oversized management packet

- **WHEN** a device sends a peer-bound management packet larger than the mesh path carries with
  fragmentation forbidden
- **THEN** the device receives fragmentation-needed from its gateway naming the mesh path size,
  and a handshake advertising a larger segment is clamped so both peers send segments that fit
