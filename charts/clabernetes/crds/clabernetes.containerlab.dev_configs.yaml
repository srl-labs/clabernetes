                      ResourcesByContainerlabKind is a mapping of container lab kind -> type -> default resource
                      settings. Note that a key value of "default" in the inner map will apply the given resources
                      for any pod of that containerlab *kind*. For example:
                      {
                        "srl": {
                          "default": DEFAULT RESOURCES FOR KIND "srl",
                          "ixr10": RESOURCES FOR KIND "srl", TYPE "ixr10"
                      }
                      Given resources as above, a containerlab node of kind "srl" and "type" ixr10" would get the
                      specific resources as allocated in the ixr10 key, whereas a containerlab kind of "srl" and
                      "type" unset or "ixr6" would get the "default" resource settings. To apply global default
                      resources, regardless of containerlab kind/type, use the `resourcesDefault` field.
