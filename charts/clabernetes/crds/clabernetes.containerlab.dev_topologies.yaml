                  Connectivity defines the type of connectivity to use between nodes in the topology. The
                  default behavior is to use vxlan tunnels, alternatively you can enable a more experimental
                  "slurpeeth" connectivity flavor that stuffs traffic into tcp tunnels to avoid any vxlan mtu
                  and/or fragmentation challenges.

                  Definition defines the actual set of nodes (network ones, not k8s ones!) that this Topology
                  CR represents. Historically, and probably most often, this means Topology holds a "normal"
                  containerlab topology file that will be "clabernetsified", however this could also be a "kne"
                  config, or perhaps others in the future.

                      ContainerlabDebug sets the `--debug` flag when invoking containerlab in the launcher pods.

                      ContainerlabVersion sets a custom version to use for containerlab -- when set this will cause
                      the launcher pods to download and use this specific version of containerlab. Setting a bad
                      version (version that doesnt exist/typo/etc.) will cause pods to fail to launch, so be
                      careful! You never "need" to this as the publicly available launcher image will always be
                      built with a (reasonably) up to date containerlab version, this setting exists in case you
                      want to pin back to an older version for some reason or you want to be bleeding edge with
                      some new feature (but do note that just because it exists in containerlab doesnt
                      *necessarily* mean it will be auto-working in clabernetes!

                            "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                            Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable

                      much, much easier to get various network operating system images booting with this enabled,
                      so, the default mode is to set the privileged flag on pods. Disabling this option causes
                      clabernetes to try to run the pods for this topology in the "not so privileged" mode -- this
                      basically means we mount all capabilities we think should be available, set apparmor to
                      "unconfined", and mount paths like /dev/kvm and dev/net/tun. With this "not so privileged"
                      mode, Nokia SRL devices and Arista cEOS devices have been able to boot on some clusters, but
                      your mileage may vary. In short: if you don't care about having some privileged pods, just
                      leave this alone.
