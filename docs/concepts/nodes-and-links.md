`Node` and `Link` resources form the primary c9s API. A Node contains one containerlab node
definition, while a Link contains one connection between two node interfaces.

Both resources are namespace-scoped. A namespace is therefore the boundary of a directly authored
lab, and both endpoints of a Link must refer to Nodes in that namespace.

## Node

The Node name is the containerlab node name. Its specification uses containerlab vocabulary for
fields such as `kind`, `image`, `type`, `startup-config`, and `exec`.

```yaml
apiVersion: c9s.run/v1alpha1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: srl1
spec:
  profileRef:
    name: lab-policy
  kind: nokia_srlinux
  image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:26.3
```

A Node can reference one same-namespace
[NodeProfile](/docs/concepts/node-profiles). If the reference is omitted, global `Config`
defaults apply. An explicit reference that does not exist prevents the Node from being realized.

### Node fields

The Node spec accepts the portable containerlab node vocabulary. Unknown fields are rejected
when the manifest is applied, and known fields without a Pod mapping fail planning with a
diagnostic naming the field.

- **Realized as declared:** `kind`, `type`, `image`, `image-pull-policy`, `entrypoint`, `cmd`,
  `env`, `user`, `sysctls`, `devices`, `cap-add`, `privileged`, `security-opts`, `tmpfs`,
  `shm-size`, `cpu`, `memory`, `dns`, `healthcheck`, `startup-delay`, `restart-policy`
  (`always` or `unless-stopped`), `exec`, `mgmt-ipv4`, `mgmt-ipv6`, `ports`, `aliases`,
  `group`, `extras`, `components`, and `certificate`.
- **Files:** `startup-config` (inline text or a path), `license`, and `binds` take their content
  from payloads attached to the Node, see
  [Containerlab file fields](/docs/guides/file-mounting#containerlab-file-fields).
- **Grouping:** `network-mode: container:<primary>` places the Node in the primary Node's Pod.
  Other network modes are rejected.
- **Link changes:** `link-apply-mode` (`live`, `restart`, or `recreate`) overrides the kind's
  default action when Links of the Node change.
- **Rejected at planning:** `config` (config-engine variables), `env-files`, `runtime`,
  `stages`, and `credentials`, see
  [Differences from containerlab](/docs/concepts/containerlab-differences).

Inside a device, node names, aliases, and chassis component names resolve to management
addresses, see [Management network](/docs/guides/management-network#name-resolution).

## Link

A Link declares exactly two endpoints: one wire, nothing else.

```yaml
apiVersion: c9s.run/v1alpha1
kind: Link
metadata:
  name: srl1-e1-1-multitool-eth1
spec:
  endpointA:
    nodeName: srl1
    interfaceName: e1-1
  endpointB:
    nodeName: multitool
    interfaceName: eth1
```

Wiring belongs only to Link objects; interfaces are not embedded into Node specifications. The
link controller validates endpoints and records a namespace-unique wire id in status, while
each device Pod's connectivity sidecar watches only the Links terminating on its own Nodes and
realizes each cross-Pod wire on the sidecar-to-sidecar fabric wire, addressed by the Link's
allocated wire id.

## Why direct resources?

Each Node grows only with its own configuration and each Link remains one wire. This removes the
single aggregate-object size limit of a source Topology and allows tooling such as `clabverter
--emitCRs` to produce independently reconciled resources.

Direct resources do not promise unlimited scale: Kubernetes API capacity, controller throughput,
and the total object count still matter.

## Complete example

The
[individual-resource SR Linux and multitool example](https://github.com/clabernetes/clabernetes/tree/main/examples/basic/individual-resources/srl-multitool)
contains a NodeProfile, two Nodes, and one Link.

See the [Node reference](/docs/crd/node) and
[Link reference](/docs/crd/link) for all fields, and [Operating a lab](/docs/guides/lab-operations)
for reading Node and Link status.
